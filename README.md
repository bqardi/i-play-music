# iPlayMusic React app

This project is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and here is the direct link to my online app:

[iPlayMusic](https://bqardi-iplaymusic.netlify.app/)

Once there, you will be presented with a login screen.
Just punch in whatever you want, there is just a veeery basic validation going on here, where you must enter at least **two** characters in the _username_ field and **four** in the _password_ field.

Or, you can simply press the One touch icon to bypass the login completely.

This is a simple practice project, so no real validations and login checks were necessary.

### First React project

This is my first React project. It is an assignment from school, where we were given the task to create a music-player using the spotify Web API ([https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/))

## The project

If you want to download this, for any reason you might have, feel free to do so.\
To set things up, you must run:

#### `npm i`

in the terminal to install all dependencies.

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm run dev`

This runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) to view it in the browser.
